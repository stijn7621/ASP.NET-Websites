# ASP.NET-Websites 
A few websites I've created with ASP.NET:


OnlineAgenda: Homework-platform for teachers and students. (Almost most recent; created with a few man)

SoccerHub: A central place where you can look for upcoming football matches as an normal user. If you're an administrator, you have the ability to add new ones, edit and delete. (older)

Tv_Series: A place where you can put your favorite tv-series (older)
